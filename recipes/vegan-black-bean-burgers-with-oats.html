            <h3>To make Vegan Black Bean Burgers, you'll need:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2x 15-ounce can black beans</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups old-fashioned oats or quick-cooking oats</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves minced</li>
                <li>1 yellow onion diced</li>
                <li>¼ cup celery minced</li>
                <li>¼ cup carrots minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground paprika</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegan mayonnaise or ketchup or BBQ sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon hemp seeds optional</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons fresh parsley chopped</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="instructions">
            <h2 class="instructions-title">Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Cook the onions, celery, 
                    and carrots for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the onions are translucent. 
                    Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds. Let cool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While the vegetables are cooling, add the old-fashioned oats to a food processor. 
                    Pulse until mostly pulverized, about 1 minute. You can leave a few bigger pieces for texture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large bowl, mash the black beans with a potato masher or large fork. 
                    Again, you can leave a few bigger pieces for texture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Form the mixture into 6 to 8 equal-sized patties. 
                    Add more oil to the skillet, and fry the patties until crispy, about 5 minutes on each side.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve on buns with leafy greens, tomato, red onion, or your favorite burger toppings. Enjoy!
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The hemp seeds add texture and extra nutrients, but you can omit them or 
                use a different type of seed, like sunflower seeds.
