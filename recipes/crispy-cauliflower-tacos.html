            Once upon a time, people would have scratched their heads at the thought of 
            cauliflower tacos.
            But thanks to the growing popularity of vegan and plant-based eating,
            the cruciferous veggie has found its place in Mexican-inspired cuisine.

            <h2 class="instructions-title">Instructions</h2>   
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 425Â° Fahrenheit. In a blender, combine the chipotle peppers and non-dairy milk. 
                    If you like very spicy flavors, feel free to add more chipotle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cut the cauliflower head into florets and, in a large bowl, toss them with the chipotle-milk mixture. 
                    Toss until the florets are fully coated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a separate smaller bowl, combine the panko breadcrumbs, cumin, onion powder, and flax meal. 
                    If you don't like or have flax meal, feel free to skip it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Coat the cauliflower florets in the panko mixture. 
                    Use a spoon or pair of tongs, as this can get messy if you do it by hand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the coated cauliflower florets on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Roast the cauliflower for 20 to 25 minutes, 
                    or until the cauliflower is tender and the coating is crispy and golden brown.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On a tortilla, layer the chipotle cauliflower with taco with your favourite fillings.
                    Fresh tomatoes, chopped onions and avocado to name a few of my favourites.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Don't forget the condiments, too. Ideas for topping options include vegan sour cream, salsa, guacamole, and lime juice.
